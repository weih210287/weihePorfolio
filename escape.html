			    Description:<br>
			    In this project, I first work a photo I took with photoshop to change it into the style I want, then put some effects on it by Audacity. I have seen some images that combine with AR, which will have some animated creatures in the photo and I think thatâ€™s great. I try to draw something with Illustrator, as you see it is trying to escape from the glitch word behind.
