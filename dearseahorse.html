			    Description:<br>
			    Since this is my first time working on 3D object I want to practice to do small changes on simple objects. After watching a tutorial about transforming a tiger to sphinx I decided to work on something similar. The process of working with meshmixer was like sculpting gypsum or clay but more difficult to do what I want. The most difficult part was to  make it solid after I finished combined them all. As they were from different file, they have variety of formations, thus, cracks appeared when I try to solid them.
